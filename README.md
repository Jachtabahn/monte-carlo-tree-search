# Monte-Carlo Tree Search

There is the main [Monte Carlo Tree Search code](https://github.com/Jachtabahn/monte-carlo-tree-search/blob/master/treesearch/searcher.go). In that source file, the function `simulate` on the bottom is the most important one: This is one stitch of the Monte Carlo Tree. This is the extension of a cleverly chosen Monte Carlo Tree branch. This is one thought of the agent.
